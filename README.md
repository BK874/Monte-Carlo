# Monte-Carlo

Used to store programs for my First Experiences in Research project:
	-HarmonicMetropolis_3 is my semi-completed version of the Metropolis algorithm for the Harmonic Oscillator
	-HarmonicMetropolis_4 is a modified version of 3 - it auto-adjusts the step size based on the percent of upward moves accepted
	-HarmonicError is used to calculate and compare the margin of error for the two Harmonic programs. The imported file is all that needs changing
	-MorseMetropolis is an implementation for the Morse potential energy function - still a work in progress
