# Monte-Carlo

Used to store programs for my First Experiences in Research project:
     -Currently finishing my Lennard Jones 3-particle system before changing it to a 13-particle system.
     -Also learning VMD for animating my simulations. 
     -Eventually I will begin work on extending the simulations to 4D.
